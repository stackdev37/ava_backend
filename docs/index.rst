Welcome to Flask's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  I would suggest to get started with the
:ref:`installation` and then heading over to the :ref:`quickstart`.  If
you want to dive into all the internal parts of Flask, check out the
:ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section.
