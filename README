                    might come in handy


    ~ What is Flask?

      Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
      and Jinja2.  It's intended for small scale applications
      and was development with best intentions in mind.

    ~ Is it ready?

      Nope, this is still work in progress, but I am happy to
      accept patches and improvements already.

    ~ What do I need?

      Currently the development versions of Jinja2 and Werkzeug.
      Because of Flask I did some refactoring in Werkzeug and
      Jinja2 and the next versions (out April 10th) will contain
      these changes.

    ~ Where are the docs?

      Go to http://flask.pocoo.org/ for a prebuild version of
      the current documentation.  Otherwise build them yourself
      from the sphinx sources in the docs folder.
