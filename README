    ~ What is Flask?

      Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
      and Jinja2.  It's intended for small scale applications
      and was development with best intentions in mind.

   ~ Is it ready?

      Nope, this is still work in progress, but I am happy to
      accept patches and improvements already.
